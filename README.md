### Who did what: 
Lidia Klosowicz: 
My contribution to the app was mostly working on the back-end part of the code, creating the database and all the functions and connections. 
The challenges I encountered were even though I made a similar enough app prior to this, the edit function and delete function had to be done differently, adding images and making them save in the database as url's and then continue to show up on another view was quite a challenge as well. Am happy to say though that making it in the Alphabetical order was much easier than I thought. Overall I'm also happy that I learned about hoisting as it's apparently a very neat skill to know (we will see about that in the future) 

Ilvie Rath: 
My contribution to the app was working on the UI Design, programming the Frontend and making as well as conducting the user study. I struggled with box alignment due to the overlay factors we had in our design and that there was no margin function, only padding. Overall I felt pretty confident working on the project and actually most things I did worked on the first try, which lead to me having extra time to work on everything else so my partner could focus on the backend. I am happy to say that I deepend my understanding in frontend programming and UI Design.
