### Who did what: 
Lidia Klosowicz: 
My contribution to the app was mostly working on the back-end part of the code, creating the database and all the functions and connections. 
The challenges I encountered were even though I made a similar enough app prior to this, the edit function and delete function had to be done differently, adding images and making them save in the database as url's and then continue to show up on another view was quite a challenge as well. Am happy to say though that making it in the Alphabetical order was much easier than I thought. Overall I'm also happy that I learned about hoisting as it's apparently a very neat skill to know (we will see about that in the future)
